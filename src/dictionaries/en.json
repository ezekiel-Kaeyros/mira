This sense of differentiation serves as the motive for 'We' to employ our power advantage to treat 'Others' in a manner that we would consider cruel or unjust if members of our own group were affected. Racism is therefore an expression of societal power relations that establish a system of differentiation, exclusion, restriction, or preference. This results in the thwarting, impairing, or denial of respecting, participating in, or exercising human rights in the political, social, economic, legal, cultural, or any other area of public or private life."

        "question": "Anti-Black Racism",
        "answer": "Anti-Black racism is specifically directed against Black people. Its origins lie in the enslavement and exploitation of the African continent and its inhabitants. To justify the brutal colonization, Europeans declared Black people to be inferior, often pseudoscientifically justified. This was particularly based on physical characteristics, such as body shape or Afro hair. Anti-Black racism, due to the visibility of Blackness, especially in dark-skinned individuals, leads to regular psychological and physical experiences of violence in private and public life."

        "question": "Anti-Asiatic Racism",
        "answer": "It is particularly specific to people to whom an Asian origin is attributed. It mostly concerns connections to South, Southeast, and East Asian countries. It manifests in narratives and prejudices and is evident in private and public life. Racism against individuals perceived as Asian is not new and is based on attitudes and narratives dating back to colonial times. It can go in various directions. On the one hand, people perceived as Asian in Germany are stigmatized as 'different' or 'dangerous.' On the other hand, there is the stereotype of 'hardworking model migrants.' Therefore, they are often denied experiences of racism."
